			<h2 class="heading">Introduction</h2>

			<p class="para-line">
				My name is Priyanshu Shrivastava. I am a recent graduate with a strong foundation in computer science and hands-on experience in various software development projects. I am passionate about leveraging technology to create innovative solutions.

I have developed proficiency in programming languages such as JavaScript, MySQL, HTML, and CSS. I have worked on several projects, including a Password Manager, an ATM System, and an Insurance Company Website, where I honed my skills in both frontend and backend development.

In addition to my technical expertise, I have demonstrated leadership and teamwork through my involvement in extracurricular activities. I have been a District Judo Champion and a Debate Champion, as well as a Student Council House Captain, where I organized workshops and training sessions to help my peers excel.

I am eager to apply my skills and knowledge in a dynamic and innovative environment, and I am particularly excited about opportunities that allow me to grow and contribute meaningfully to the team.
